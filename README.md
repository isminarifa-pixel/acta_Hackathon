# 🧓 Hi Nani!! 👵💬  
**Every conversation becomes a memory!**

Hi Nani! is an **AI-powered app** designed to help grandparents share their life stories through warm, interactive conversations — just like talking to their grandchildren.  

The app gently prompts them to talk about their **moods, feelings, health, and memories.**  
With their permission, each conversation is saved as **audio or text files** and shared with family members (like their children) through WhatsApp — bringing joy and connection to every generation. 💖
