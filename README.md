#Hi Nani!! ðŸ‘µðŸ’¬
**Every conversation becomes a memory!**
Hi Nani! is an AI powered app designed to help grandparents share their lifestories through warm, interactive conversations - just like talking to their grandchildren.
This app gently prompts them to talk about their moods, feelings, health, and memories.Then the conversation is converted to audio files or text files after taking granny's permission and the playful conversation between granny and grandchild will be sent to granny's children through whatsapp which will make them happy as well...
ðŸ’–Goal: To preserve love, laughter,wisdom and precious memories of our grandparents across generations...
ðŸ§ **Built for ACTA HACKATHON 2025**
