# ðŸ§  Market Research and Problem Statement â€” Hi Nani! ðŸ‘µðŸ’¬

## 1. Problem Overview
Across the world, millions of grandparents experience emotional loneliness and crave meaningful conversations with their loved ones.  
They hold beautiful life stories, experiences, and wisdom â€” but often lack someone to listen or record them.  
Meanwhile, younger family members wish to stay connected but struggle due to distance, time differences, or busy lifestyles.

**Hi Nani!** aims to bridge this emotional gap through friendly AI-powered conversations that feel warm, personal, and human â€” just like chatting with their grandchildren.
