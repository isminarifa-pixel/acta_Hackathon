Memory Keeper for Grandparents – Project Submission Summary
💡 Inspiration

Grandparents hold a treasure of stories, experiences, and wisdom. Many families wish they could preserve these memories, but there’s no simple tool for elderly users to share their stories naturally. Memory Keeper for Grandparents is designed to bridge that gap.

🧩 Problem Statement

Elderly users often face technology barriers, making it hard to document memories. Families may not have time to record stories manually. There’s a need for a friendly, interactive solution that preserves these memories safely.

🚀 Solution

Memory Keeper is an AI-driven app that:

Engages grandparents in warm, playful conversations as they are talking to their grandchildren

Records voice and converts it into text stories

Allows sharing these stories with family via WhatsApp

Keeps all memories safe and organized

Think Duolingo meets Family Album, but for life stories.
